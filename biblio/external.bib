  Abstract                 = {Cosmic ray positrons are known to be produced in interactions in the interstellar medium. As well as originating from this 'secondary source', positrons might also be generated in primary sources such as pulsars and microquasars -- or by dark matter annihilation. A new measurement of the positron fraction in the cosmic radiation for the energy range 1.5-100 GeV has been made using data from the PAMELA satellite experiment. Previous measurements, made predominantly by balloon-borne instruments, yield a positron fraction compatible with 'secondary source' production from interactions between cosmic ray nuclei and interstellar matter. Above 10 GeV the new measurements deviate significantly from this expectation, pointing to the presence of a primary source, either a nearby astrophysical object or dark matter particle annihilations.},

These forays to the edge of space have resulted in the detection of an excess of Galactic cosmic-ray electrons at energies of around 300-800 GeV, which indicates a nearby source of energetic electrons. The source could be an unseen astrophysical object that accelerates electrons to those energies, or the electrons could arise from the annihilation of 'Kaluza-Klein' dark matter, an exotic concept predicted by theories of the Universe involving compactified extra dimensions.},

  Abstract                 = {In high energy experiments such as active beam dump searches for rare decays and missing energy events, the beam purity is a crucial parameter. In this paper we present a technique to reject heavy charged particle contamination in the 100 GeV electron beam of the H4 beam line at CERN SPS. The method is based on the detection with BGO scintillators of the synchrotron radiation emitted by the electrons passing through a bending dipole magnet. A 100 GeV Ïâ beam is used to test the method in the NA64 experiment resulting in a suppression factor of 10â5 while the efficiency for electron detection is â¼95%. The spectra and the rejection factors are in very good agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation. The reported suppression factors are significantly better than previously achieved.},

  Abstract                 = {Dark photon (Aâ²) that couples to the standard model fermions via the kinetic mixing with photons and serves as a mediator of dark matter production could be observed in the high-energy electron scattering eâ+Zâeâ+Z+Aâ² off nuclei followed by the bremsstrahlung Aâ²âinvisible decay. We cross check the exact tree-level calculations of the Aâ² production cross sections by other results and implement them in the program for the full simulation of such events in the experiment NA64 at the CERN SPS . Using simulations results, we study the missing energy signature for the Aâ²âinvisible decay that allows to probe the Î³âAâ² mixing strength in a wide, from sub-MeV to sub-GeV, Aâ² mass range. We refine and expand our earlier studies of this signature by including corrections to the previously used calculations based on the improved WeizsakerâWilliams (IWW) approximation, which turn out to be significant. We find that the commonly used IWW approach can lead to substantial overestimation of the sensitivity to Aâ² in fixed target experiments. The possibility of future searches with high-energy electron beams and their sensitivity to Aâ² are briefly discussed.},

However, at the one-loop level the Zâ² coupling to electrons or quarks can be induced via the Î³âZâ² kinetic mixing, which is generated through the loop involving the muon and tau lepton. This loophole has important experimental consequences since it opens up new possibilities for the complementary searches of the Zâ² with high-energy electron beams, in particular in the ongoing NA64 and incoming dark photon experiments. An extension of the model able to explain relic Dark Matter density is also discussed.},

We discuss the normalization and presentation of results to allow comparison between different target elements and with theoretical predictions.

We perform a systematic global determination of the form factors covering a wide range of nuclei, from 9Be to 209Bi. The commonly-used Lewin-Smith approach is improved by fitting both parameters of the Fermi proton-density distributions directly to the experimental data. Our procedure allows to extract the widely-used Helm form factor, providing for the first time realistic (conservative) uncertainties for the parameters. In addition, we rely on recent measurements of antiprotonic atoms to constrain the neutron-density distributions. Systematics errors are estimated and possible correlations are explored.},

The longitudinal development has been carefully treated and a satisfactory analytical representation is suggested as a convenient tool for many practical problems. The lateral spread has been analyzed and estimated from different points of view. Fluctuations obtained from the Monte Carlo calculation for the track length of showers within 5, 10 and 15X0 of SF5 are presented. They have also been obtained for an array of 9 counters - each 1ÃX0 thick - placed one behind the other. These results have been interpolated rather accurately with a Polya distribution for a convenient set of values of the corresponding parameters.},

For this purpose we design and test a massively parallel pattern-recognition algorithm, inspired to the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by the primary visual cortex of mammals in the early stages of visual-information processing. The detailed geometry and charged-particle's activity of a large tracking detector are simulated and used to assess the performance of the artificial retina algorithm. We find that high-quality tracking in large detectors is possible with sub-microsecond latencies when the algorithm is implemented in modern, high-speed, high-bandwidth FPGA devices.}

abstract = {For software developers of all experience levels looking to improve their results, and design and implement domain-driven enterprise applications consistently with the best current state of professional practice, Implementing Domain-Driven Design will impart a treasure trove of knowledge hard won within the DDD and enterprise application architecture communities over the last couple decades. Randy Stafford, Architect At-Large, Oracle Coherence Product Development This book is a must-read for anybody looking to put DDD into practice. Udi Dahan, Founder of NServiceBus Implementing Domain-Driven Design presents a top-down approach to understanding domain-driven design (DDD) in a way that fluently connects strategic patterns to fundamental tactical programming tools. Vaughn Vernon couples guided approaches to implementation with modern architectures, highlighting the importance and value of focusing on the business domain while balancing technical considerations. Building on Eric Evans seminal book, Domain-Driven Design, the author presents practical DDD techniques through examples from familiar domains. Each principle is backed up by realistic Java examplesall applicable to C developersand all content is tied together by a single case study: the delivery of a large-scale Scrum-based SaaS system for a multitenant environment. The author takes you far beyond DDD-lite approaches that embrace DDD solely as a technical toolset, and shows you how to fully leverage DDDs strategic design patterns using Bounded Context, Context Maps, and the Ubiquitous Language. Using these techniques and examples, you can reduce time to market and improve quality, as you build software that is more flexible, more scalable, and more tightly aligned to business goals. Coverage includes Getting started the right way with DDD, so you can rapidly gain value from it Using DDD within diverse architectures, including Hexagonal, SOA, REST, CQRS, Event-Driven, and Fabric/Grid-Based Appropriately designing and applying Entitiesand learning when to use Value Objects instead Mastering DDDs powerful new Domain Events technique Designing Repositories for ORM, NoSQL, and other databases}

abstract = {The ROOT system in an Object Oriented framework for large scale data analysis. ROOT written in C++, contains, among others, an efficient hierarchical OO database, a C++ interpreter, advanced statistical analysis (multi-dimensional histogramming, fitting, minimization, cluster finding algorithms) and visualization tools. The user interacts with ROOT via a graphical user interface, the command line or batch scripts. The command and scripting language is C++ (using the interpreter) and large scripts can be compiled and dynamically linked in. The OO database design has been optimized for parallel access (reading as well as writing) by multiple processes.}

One particularly interesting example is a so-called axion-like particle (ALP), i.e. a pseudoscalar coupled to two photons. The challenge in proton beam dumps is to reliably calculate the production of the new particles from the interactions of two composite objects, the proton and the target atoms. In this work we argue that Primakoff production of ALPs proceeds in a momentum range where production rates and angular distributions can be determined to sufficient precision using simple electromagnetic form factors. Reanalysing past proton beam dump experiments for this production channel, we derive novel constraints on the parameter space for ALPs. We show that the NA62 experiment at CERN could probe unexplored parameter space by running in `dump mode' for a few days and discuss opportunities for future experiments such as SHiP.},

abstract = {A number of challenges to the standard ÎCDM model have been emerging during the past few years as the accuracy of cosmological observations improves. In this review we discuss in a unified manner many existing signals in cosmological and astrophysical data that appear to be in some tension (2Ï or larger) with the standard ÎCDM model as specified by the Cosmological Principle, General Relativity and the Planck18 parameter values. In addition to the well-studied 5Ï challenge of ÎCDM (the Hubble H0 tension) and other well known tensions (the growth tension, and the lensing amplitude AL anomaly), we discuss a wide range of other less discussed less-standard signals which appear at a lower statistical significance level than the H0 tension some of them known as âcuriositiesâ in the data) which may also constitute hints towards new physics. For example such signals include cosmic dipoles (the fine structure constant Î±, velocity and quasar dipoles), CMB asymmetries, BAO LyÎ± tension, age of the Universe issues, the Lithium problem, small scale curiosities like the coreâcusp and missing satellite problems, quasars Hubble diagram, oscillating short range gravity signals etc. The goal of this pedagogical review is to collectively present the current status (2022 update) of these signals and their level of significance, with emphasis on the Hubble tension and refer to recent resources where more details can be found for each signal. We also briefly discuss theoretical approaches that can potentially explain some of these signals.}

abstract={In many fields of science and industry the computing environment has grown at an exponential speed in the past 30 years. From ad hoc solutions for each problem, the field has evolved gradually to use or reuse systems developed across the years for the same environment or coming from other fields with the same requirements. Several frameworks have emerged to solve common problems. In High Energy Physics (HEP) and Nuclear Physics, we have witnessed the emergence of common tools, packages and libraries that have become gradually the corner stone of the computing in these fields. The emergence of these systems has been complex because the computing field is evolving rapidly, the problems to be solved more and more complex and the size of the experiments now involving several thousand physicists from all over the world. This paper describes the emergence of these frameworks and their evolution from libraries including independent subroutines to task-oriented packages and to general experiments frameworks.},

    abstract = {Particle physics is the science that pursues the age-old quest for the innermost structure of matter and the fundamental interactions between its constituents. Modern experiments in this field rely increasingly on calorimetry, a detection technique in which the particles of interest are absorbed in the detector. Calorimeters are very intricate instruments, their performance characteristics depend in subtle, sometimes counter-intuitive ways on design details. This book, written by one of the world's foremost experts, is the only comprehensive text on this topic. It provides a fundamental and systematic introduction, in which many intriguing calorimeter features are explained. It also describes the state-of-the-art, both for what concerns the fundamental understanding of calorimetric particle detection and the actual detectors that have been or are being built and operated in experiments. In the last chapter, some landmark scientific discoveries in which calorimetry has played an important role are discussed. This book summarizes and puts in perspective work described in some 900 scientific papers, listed in the bibliography. This second edition emphasizes new developments that have taken place since the the first edition appeared (2000).},

We report on a significantly improved version of GENFIT, based on experience gained in the Belle II, PÌANDA, and FOPI experiments. Improvements concern the implementation of additional track-fitting algorithms, enhanced implementations of Kalman fitters, enhanced visualization capabilities, and additional implementations of measurement types suited for various kinds of tracking detectors. The data model has been revised, allowing for efficient track merging, smoothing, residual calculation, alignment, and storage.}

New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

The parameterization of the trajectory has to account for bending in the magnetic field, energy loss and multiple scattering in the detector material. General broken lines implement a track model with the proper description of multiple scattering leading to linear with a special structure of the corresponding matrix allowing for a fast solution with the computing time depending linearly on the number of measurements. The calculation of the full covariance matrix along the trajectory enables the application to track based alignment and calibration of large detectors with global methods.}

The purpose of the BTR is to provide a reliable basis for the construction, commissioning and operation of FAIR. The BTR is one of the central documents requested by the FAIR International Steering Committee (ISC) and its working groups, in order to prepare the legal process and the decisions on the construction and operation of FAIR in an international framework. It provides the technical basis for legal contracts on contributions to be made by, so far, 13 countries within the international FAIR Consortium. The BTR begins with this extended Executive Summary as Volume 1, which is also intended for use as a stand-alone document. The Executive Summary provides brief summaries of the accelerator facilities, the scientific programs and experimental stations, civil construction and safety, and of the workproject structure, costs and schedule.

abstract = {The FairRoot framework is an object oriented simulation, reconstruction and data analysis framework based on ROOT. It includes core services for detector simulation and offline analysis. The framework delivers base classes which enable the users to easily construct their experimental setup in a fast and convenient way. By using the Virtual Monte Carlo concept it is possible to perform the simulations using either Geant3 or Geant4 without changing the user code or the geometry description. Using and extending the task mechanism of ROOT it is possible to implement complex analysis tasks in a convenient way. Moreover, using the FairCuda interface of the framework it is possible to run some of these tasks also on GPU. Data IO, as well as parameter handling and data base connections are also handled by the framework. Since some of the experiments will not have an experimental setup with a conventional trigger system, the framework can handle also free flowing input streams of detector data. For this mode of operation the framework provides classes to create the needed time sorted input streams of detector data out of the event based simulation data. There are also tools to do radiation studies and to visualize the simulated data. A CMake-CDash based building and monitoring system is also part of the FairRoot services which helps to build and test the framework on many different platforms in an automatic way, including also Continuous Integration.}

A blind analysis avoids the possibility of experimenters biasing their result toward their own preconceptions by preventing them from knowing the answer until the analysis is complete. There is at least circumstantial evidence that such a bias has affected past measurements, and as experiments have become costlier and more difficult and hence harder to reproduce, the possibility of bias has become a more important issue than in the past. We describe here the motivations for performing a blind analysis, and give several modern examples of successful blind analysis strategies.",

The most well-known use of this framework is for the combined search for the Higgs boson at LEP. A toy neutrino oscillations experiment is used to illustrate the rich information available in the framework for exclusion and discovery. I argue that the so-called CLs technique for setting limits is appropriate for determining exclusion intervals while the determination of confidence intervals advocated by Feldman and Cousins' method is more appropriate for treating established signals, i.e. going beyond discovery to measurement.

abstract = {Recent results on the gaseous microstrip detector Micromegas which will be used to track particles in the COMPASS experiment at CERN are presented. Developments concerning its mechanical and electrical design, associated readout electronics and gas mixture were carried out. Particular attention was paid to the discharge phenomenon which affects this type of microstrip detector. The adequacy of the options finally retained, especially the SFE16 readout and the use of a NeâC2H6âCF4 gas mixture, was demonstrated in a set of beam tests performed on a 26Ã36cm2 prototype. Operating at a gain of â¼6400, full efficiency is reached along with a spatial resolution of â¼50Î¼m and a timing accuracy of 8.5ns. Discharges are kept at a low rate, less than one per SPS spill in a COMPASS-like environment. Via a decoupling of the strips through individual capacitors their impact is greatly reduced. They generate a dead time on the full detector of â¼3ms, affecting marginally the detection efficiency given their rate. The probability of discharge, at a given value of efficiency, is found to decrease with the mean value of the gas mixture atomic number. In view of these results, the commissioning of Micromegas for COMPASS is foreseen in the near future.}

abstract = {We introduce the gas electrons multiplier (GEM), a composite grid consisting of two metal layers separated by a thin insulator, etched with a regular matrix of open channels. A GEM grid with the electrodes kept at a suitable difference of potential, inserted in a gas detector on the path of drifting electrons, allows to pre-amplify the charge drifting through the channels. Coupled to other devices, multiwire or microstrip chambers, it permits to obtain higher gains, or to operate in less critical conditions. The separation of sensitive and detection volumes offers other advantages: a built-in delay, a strong suppression of photon feedback. Applications are foreseen in high rate tracking and Cherenkov Ring Imaging detectors. Multiple GEM grids assembled in the same gas volume allow to obtain large effective amplification factors in a succession of steps.}

abstract = {The gas electron multiplier (GEM) used as single proportional counter or in a cascade of two or more elements, permits to attain high gains and to perform detection and localization of ionizing tracks at very high radiation rates. As in other micro-pattern detectors, however, the occasional occurrence of heavily ionizing trails may trigger a local breakdown, with possible harmful consequences on the device itself and on the readout electronics. This paper describes a systematic investigation of the discharge mechanisms in single and multiple GEM structures, and suggests various strategies to reduce both the energy and the probability of the discharges.}

abstract = {Simulations of the punch-through in hadronic showers will be presented. This includes a detailed analysis of the beam fragmentation in hadron-nucleus interactions. The results shown have been obtained with the GHEISHA and GEANT Monte Carlo programs. Comparisons with experimental data in the range of 2â300 GeV beam energy will be performed. The use of a fast Monte Carlo version, based on simplifications of the general GHEISHA shower simulation program, will be described and the limits of applicability will be investigated. Alternative solutions of punch-through calculations by use of the Boltzmann transport equation will be demonstrated. Muon identification in past and future collider experiments is reviewed and the performance will be compared with predictions of Monte Carlo calculations.}
