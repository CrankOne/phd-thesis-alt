abstract = {We present the package for the simulation of DM (Dark Matter) particles in fixed target experiments. The most convenient way of this simulation (and the only possible way in the case of beam-dump) is to simulate it in the framework of the Monte-Carlo program performing the particle tracing in the experimental setup. The Geant4 toolkit framework was chosen as the most popular and versatile solution nowadays. Specifically, the package includes the codes for the simulation of the processes of DM particles production via electron and muon bremsstrahlung off nuclei, resonant in-flight positron annihilation on atomic electrons and gamma to ALP (axion-like particles) conversion on nuclei. Four types of DM mediator particles are considered: vector, scalar, pseudoscalar and axial vector. The total cross sections of bremsstrahlung processes are calculated numerically at exact tree level (ETL). The code handles both the case of invisible DM decay and of visible decay into e+e− (μ+μ− for Z′, γγ for ALP). The proposed extension implements native Geant4 application programming interfaces (API) designed for these needs and can be unobtrusively embedded into the existing applications. As an example of its usage, we discuss the results obtained from the simulation of a typical active beam-dump experiment. We consider 5×1012 100 GeV electrons impinging on a lead/plastic heterogeneous calorimeter playing a role of an active thick target. The expected sensitivity of the experiment to the four types of DM mediator particles mentioned above is then derived.
Program summary
Program Title: DMG4 CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/6m3yhx4ssw.1 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3 Programming language: c++ Nature of problem: The optimal way to simulate Dark Matter production processes in fixed target experiments in most cases is to do it inside the program for the full simulation of the experimental setup and not separately, in event generators. The code that can be easily embedded in such programs is needed. The code should be able to simulate various DM production processes that happen in a thick target, in particular on nuclei, with maximal accuracy. Solution method: We created a Geant4 compatible DM simulation package for this purpose. The choice of this simulation framework is suggested by its popularity and versatility. The code includes the cross sections precalculated at exact tree level for a wide variety of DM particles.},

abstract = {The search for new comparably light (well below the electroweak scale) feebly interacting particles is an exciting possibility to explain some mysterious phenomena in physics, among them the origin of Dark Matter. The sensitivity study through detailed simulation of projected experiments is a key point in estimating their potential for discovery. Several years ago we created the DMG4 package for the simulation of DM (Dark Matter) particles in fixed target experiments. The natural approach is to integrate this simulation into the same program that performs the full simulation of particles in the experiment setup. The Geant4 toolkit framework was chosen as the most popular and versatile solution nowadays. The simulation of DM particles production by this package accommodates several possible scenarios, employing electron, muon or photon beams and involving various mediators, such as vector, axial vector, scalar, pseudoscalar, or spin 2 particles. The bremsstrahlung, annihilation or Primakoff processes can be simulated. The package DMG4 contains a subpackage DarkMatter with cross section methods weakly connected to Geant4. It can be used in different frameworks. In this paper, we present the latest developments of the package, such as extending the list of possible mediator particle types, refining formulas for the simulation and extending the mediator mass range. The user interface is also made more flexible and convenient. In this work, we also demonstrate the usage of the package, the improvements in the simulation accuracy and some cross check validations.

Phys. Commun. 269 (2021) 108129 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Reasons for the new version: Numerous developments, addition of new features Summary of revisions: WW approximation cross sections for the muon beam are implemented and cross-checked, models with semivisible A′ (inelastic Dark Matter) and spin 2 mediators are added. The range of possible mediator masses is extended. Several important improvements for the annihilation processes are made, the number of possible annihilation processes is extended. User interface is improved. Several bugs are fixed. Nature of problem: For the simulation of Dark Matter production processes in fixed target experiments a code that can be easily integrated in programs for the full simulation of experimental setup is needed. Solution method: A fully Geant4 compatible DM simulation package DMG4 was presented in 2020. We present numerous further developments of this package.},
